1. What is your topic? Can you phrase your topic in the form of a question that you hope to answer?
A: Given an article title, how accurately can we predict the popularity of that article published on TalkingPointsMemo.com (TPM).

2. What do you plan to use as your source of data? Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? Any other characteristics you know of?
A: I will be analyzing a list of 10,000 articles published over the last year on TPM. They will all be tied to politics, since TPM is a political news media company. Besides titles, each article will also have a teaser and the body content. The articles will be downloaded through our company's database.
Each article's popularity will be measured by page views via the Parse.ly API, number of likes via the Facebook API, and number of retweets via the Twitter API.

3. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end? In other words, what are your learning objectives?
A: Since none of the articles are currently categorized, I will first try to do that through an unsupervised categorization model. A hypothetical question of my learning objective could be "Given a title, how many page views will the article receive after one week?"
